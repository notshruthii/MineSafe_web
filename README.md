# MineSafe Web App

<h3>Description:</h3>
The problem statement that MineSafe aims to address is to create a platform that enhances worker safety, task management, and real-time monitoring in underground mining environments. The platform integrates modern web technologies and voice assistance to streamline daily operations and ensure accountability, while also providing supervisors with oversight and data for decision-making.<br><br>

<h4>MineSafe intends to solve the following problems:</h4><br>
	Ensuring that mining equipment and environments are consistently checked and logged.<br>
	Empowering supervisors to oversee real-time safety and worker activity.<br>
	Improving worker experience through accessible dashboards and voice-assisted form filling.<br><br>

<h3>Features:<h3>
	Landing page for supervisors and workers.<br>
	Login portal for workers.<br>
	Voice assistance to help workers fill forms during shift handover.<br>
	<b>Worker dashboard showing real-time safety parameters:</b><br>
	COâ‚‚ levels<br>
	Machinery condition<br>
	Battery health and status of equipment<br>
	Geofencing alerts and entry/exit logs.<br>
	Supervisor monitoring of assigned workers, including performance and safety warnings.<br>
	Duration tracking for time spent underground.<br>
	Equipment status visibility (active/inactive machines).<br><br>

(Future addition): A 2D interactive map of the coal mine on the landing page.<br><br>
